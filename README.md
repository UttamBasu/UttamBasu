🔧 Senior Embedded Software Engineer | Aerospace & Defense • RTOS • DMA • Cortex‑M • Firmware Architecture • Patents & Technical Papers

I'm an embedded systems specialist with ~6 years of experience in designing, implementing, and optimizing real-time firmware for mission-critical aerospace applications. Currently at Collins Aerospace (and formerly Honeywell), I focus on:

  🧠 RTOS & Bare-metal Integration: Real-time scheduling, preemptive tasks, low-latency ISR handlers (UART, TIMER, DMA).
  ⚙️ DMA-Driven Zero-Copy Data Paths: Efficient sensor/camera interfacing with minimal CPU overhead.
  🖥️ Device Drivers & Peripherals: SPI, I²C, ADC, GPIO, and custom display backplanes on ARM Cortex‑M microcontrollers.
  💾 Firmware Architecture & Memory Management: Bootloaders, secure OTA updates, use of FRAM-based memory mapping for robust firmware reloads.
  🛡️ Secure & Reliable Code Delivery: CRC/authenticated updates, staging partitions to ensure safe OTA, rollback on failure.


📄 Patents & Publications
  ⚙️ Secure Firmware Update System – co-inventor on a granted patent for frictionless, secure embedded firmware provisioning (e.g., updating peripheral device code via authenticated protocols).
  ⚙️ FERAM Memory Expansion for Firmware Updates – contributor to methods using ferroelectric memory to support in-field firmware updates with continuous access .
  ⚙️ Co-authored technical paper on DMA-based zero-copy buffers optimizing data throughput in real-time systems (internal whitepaper at Collins Aerospace).


💡 Community Content & Educational Tech Blogs
  ⚙️ I share embedded-focused content, including:
  ⚙️ Mini-lectures & quizzes on pointer robustness, static variables across ISRs, and race conditions.
  ⚙️ Tech breakdowns of interrupt latency optimization, nested vector interrupt controllers (NVIC), and ARM SysTick/syscon intricacies.

Firmware design guides: layering clean abstraction over bare-metal drivers; unit-testing using hardware abstraction layers and mock frameworks.


🚀 On GitHub You’ll Find
  🔹 Modular RTOS-ready peripheral driver libraries for SPI, UART, DMA
  🔹 Firmware frameworks with DMA zero-copy patterns and task-separation
  🔹 Sample projects: bootloader + update partition, CRC/secure boot routines
  🔹 Code-challenge puzzles: threading traps, ISR reentrancy, pointer aliasing
