I am Firmware Engineer with experience in low-level driver programming, different sensor integration, networking, hardware, PCB designing & IoT. Earlier, I was Junior Lecturer of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering Department of a well-reputed and NBA accredited Diploma Engineering Institute. Published multiple International Journals and Indian Patents especially based on Embedded systems & Computer Vision. Undergrad degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering and my Masters in Data Science and Engineering gave me a deeper insight into Embedded Cloud AI-based product designing and working on complete product lifecycle and doing live data analysis using Python and different machine learning algorithms. I want to build robust and scalable hardware products with the help of technical and algorithmic skills I acquired through my education in Embedded systems in my professional life. I am also a quick learner, I am happy to say that every day I am learning from seniors, juniors, & friends.
